# PlatPractice Maps Branch

Here are all of our unconverted Tiled maps!

### Uploading

Please DO NOT compress/zip your files. Place them in subfolders with descriptive names. (For example, `ForestMap` or `Castle`; avoid names like Test or `placeholder`.)

You can commit and push as normal. Since this technically isn't traditional code, avoid editing other contributors' files unless you have explicit permission from them. Merge conflicts can get real nasty!
